The weekly mini-quizzes cover material from the lectures each week, and are graded for *completion credit*. We believe they are a useful tool to check your understanding of the material and to prepare for the quizzes. As long as you have submitted a *reasonable* attempt on Gradescope, you will receive *full credit* for the miniquiz.
